What is this?
Secure Message Board project
This is a very simple but secure message board system.

What have you consider?

- You can use any password. The only requiremens is that it should be at least 8 chars long. Spaces, phrases are accepted
- Email of the user must be confirmed before using the system
- It's mandatory to used two factor authentication
- The password is hashed before inserting it in DB
- A lot of SQL inyection test have been made

How do I use it:
Two options:
a) Use it online at: http://coursera.acostasite.com:8000/

b) Install using the following procedure:

Requirements:
- Flask  (apt-get install python-pip3; pip3 install Flask)
- Python3
- MySQL (apt-get install mysql-server)
- MTA (Email Server) (in my case using Postfix in the same server) (apt-get install postfix)

1) Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/alejandroacostaalamo2/courseracybersecurity

2) Create the DB
cd courseracybersecurity
mysql -u root -p -e "create database COURSERA"; 
mysql -u root -p -h localhost COURSERA < schema.sql
CREATE USER 'root'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'coursera'; (probably already have these users)
CREATE USER 'readonly'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'coursera'; (probably already have these users)
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON * . * TO 'root'@'localhost';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON * . * TO 'readonly'@'localhost';

Running:
Just type: python3 index.py

Do you want a snapshot of the DB?. A daily copy is generated and can be downloaded rigth here:
http://coursera.acostasite.com:8000/DB/db_backup.sql


TODO
- Second factor auth could be just a code, not a link. Maybe to have both options
- Link for confirmation could be just a code, not a link. Maybe both options
- Change password (however you can use: lost password)
- Some mechanishm like garbage collector should exists for cleaning the DB (when user is not confirmed and so on)
- Encrypt the full DB?
- HTTPS Web site
